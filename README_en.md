## 🚀 Key Features

### 📬 Email Aggregation

Alle achieves aggregation through the **automatic forwarding features** of various email service providers.
Users only need to set up forwarding rules in their original email accounts to automatically send emails to the dedicated address provided by the Alle platform,
allowing them to view all email inbox content from a single interface.

> ✅ Supports Gmail, Outlook, QQ Mail and other major email providers
> ✅ Supports forwarding configuration for custom domain emails
> ✅ No need to enter email passwords, safe and reliable

This aggregation approach avoids the hassle of logging into multiple platforms and reduces security risks, easily achieving "receive all emails in one place".

### 🤖 AI Recognition

Alle's built-in AI engine analyzes email content and automatically identifies and extracts key information.

**Recognition includes:**
- 🔐 **Verification codes**: Automatically identifies and extracts verification code content, supporting quick copy and use.
- 🔗 **Link identification and classification**: Intelligently distinguishes different types of links in emails:
  - 📨 **Verification links**: Used for registration, login confirmation, identity verification and other scenarios (such as logging into GitHub, verifying new devices).
  - ⚙️ **Service links**: Identifies notification links from services like GitHub, GitLab, Notion (such as commits, pull requests, task changes, etc.).
  - 🚫 **Subscription links**: Identifies unsubscribe or preference management links in advertising marketing emails, helping users quickly clean up unnecessary subscriptions.

The AI recognition feature makes email reading more intuitive, allowing users to complete operations directly from the extracted results, greatly improving the user experience.

### 📨 Temporary Email Service

With the domain email functionality of **Cloudflare Workers**, Alle allows users to quickly create **unlimited temporary email addresses**.

These temporary email addresses can be used for:

- ⚡ Temporarily receiving one-time information or test emails

All emails received by temporary email addresses are automatically integrated into the main interface for unified management, avoiding missed messages.
